# go-levy
go-levy is a golang port of a Stochastic Process Generation Algorithm introduced by Rosario Nunzio Mantegna in 1994 edition of [Physical Review E](https://journals.aps.org/pre/).


I decided to place it here after finding an interest in a specific metaheuristic (Cuckoo Search AKA obligate brood parasitism) as a form of Relevance Feedback in Information Retrieval.


Grab it by typing:

```go get github.com/jtejido/go-levy```


P.S. the implementation needed to run it is in gl.go
